# Fiction writing tools

These are not polished, finished, stand-alone applications.
These are frameworks you can customize for the fiction you're working on.

Therefore, kindly do **not** simply run these without further customization.
The outputs are recognizable with simple statistical checks.

1.  ``plot.py`` Uses Tarot card layouts to create a story line.

2.  ``terrain-tk.py``, and ``notebooks/terrain.ipynb`` Draws a hex-grid map. 

3.  ``features.py`` Creates physical features and descriptions of characters.

4.  ``language.py`` Implements a specific conLang for a series of books.
    This includes a few grammar rules and lexicon rules to create words.

5.  ``names.py`` Uses a list of common English nouns;
    this can lead to occupation names (think "smith" and "miller").

6.  ``miseries.py`` Develops human miseries.
