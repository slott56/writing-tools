Writing Tools for TTRPG or Literature
======================================

Some tool frameworks and design ideas to help fiction writers.

The idea here is **not** to provide any polished, finished applications.

The idea is to provide code you can extend and modify to fit the fiction you want to write.
This can be books, stories, or TTRPG scenarios.
Don't simply run these.
Understand them and extend them.
